### Basic Feature Engineering in Keras
In the notebook *keras_basic_feature_engineering.ipynb* we utlize feature engineering to improve the prediction of **housing prices** using a Keras Sequential Model on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

- Create an input pipeline using tf.data.
- Engineer features to create categorical, crossed, and numerical feature columns.


### Advanced Feature Engineering in Keras
In the notebook *keras_advanced_feature_engineering.ipynb*, we use Keras to build a taxifare price prediction model and utilize feature engineering to improve the fare amount prediction for NYC taxi cab rides.

- Process temporal feature columns in Keras.
- Use Lambda layers to perform feature engineering on geolocation features.
- Create bucketized and crossed feature columns.
